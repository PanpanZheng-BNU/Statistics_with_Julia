    "# Chapter04 Processing and Summarizing Data\n",
    "- In statistics nomenclature, the act of summarizing data is known as ***descriptive statistics***. In data science nomenclature such activities take the names of ***analytics*** and ***dash-boarding***, while the process of manipulating and pre-processing data is sometimes called ***data cleansing***, or ***data cleaning***.\n",

    "## Mutability, References, Shallow Copies and Deep Copies in Julia\n",
    "- Two different mechanisms for passing variables to functions.\n",
    "  - ***Call by value*** `f()` gets a copy of the variable `x`. As `f()` executes, even if the code appears to modify x, it is actually modifying a local copy.\n",
    "  - ***Call by reference*** `f()` obtains a ***memory reference*** (***pointer***) to `x`. In such a case, as `f()` executes, if it modifies `x`, then it actually modifies values in the original memory location of `x`.\n",
    "- In Julia, both mechanisms exist under a unified umbrella called ***pass by sharing***. This means that variables are not copied when passed to funcitons. However, if a value is about to a changed within a function then depending on the mutability attribute of its types.\n",
    "  - If the variable type is ***immutable*** then a local copy is made and the behavior follows the \"call by value\" type.\n",
    "  - If the variable type is ***mutable*** then the called function does not create a local copy. Instead, it can modify the original variable according to \"call by reference\" mechanisms.\n",
    "- In Julia, primitive type such as `Int64` or `Float32` are immutable. But arrays are mutable."
