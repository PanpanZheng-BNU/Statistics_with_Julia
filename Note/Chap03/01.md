# Random Variables
- ***Example1*** Assume a sample space $$\Omega$$ which consists of six names. Assume that probability function, $$\mathbb{P}(\cdot)$$, assigns uniform probability to each of the names. Let now, $$X: \Omega \to \mathbb{Z}$$, be the function that counts the number of letters in each name. Then question is then finding:
$$
p(x) := \mathbb{P}(X=x), \quad \text{for } x\in \mathbb{Z}
$$
- The function $$p(x)$$ represents the ***probability distribution*** of the ***random variable*** $$X$$. Since $$X$$ measures the length of names, $$X$$ is a discrete random variable, and its probability distribution may be represented by ***Probability Mass Function (PMF)***, such as $$p(x)$$

using StatsBase, Plots

names = ["Mary", "Mel", "David", "John", "Kaylay", "Anderson"]
randomName() = rand(names)
X = 3:8
N = 10^6
sampleLengths = [length(randomName()) for _ in 1:N]

bar(X, counts(sampleLengths)/N, ylims=(0,0.35),

## Types of Random Variables
- ***Discrete Random Variable*** i.e. The number of letters of one's name.
- ***Continuous Random Variable*** i.e. The weights of people randomly selected from a big population.
- In describing the probability distribution of a continuous random variable, the probability mass function, $$p(x)$$, is no longer applicable. This is because for a continuous random variable $$X$$, $$\mathbb{P}(X = x)$$ for any particular value of $$x$$ is $$0$$. Hence, in this case, the ***Probability Density Function (PDF)***, $$f(x)$$ is used, where
$$
f(x)\Delta\approx\mathbb{P}(x\le X \le x+\Delta)
$$
- Here the approximate becomes exact as $$\Delta\to 0$$
- Three examples of distributions
  - **Discrete Distribution**: 
  $$
  p(x)\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0.25 & \text{for }x=0,\\0.25 & \text{for }x=1,\\ 0.5 & \text{for }x=2.\end{array} \right. \\
  \Downarrow\\
  \sum_{x}p(x) = 1
  $$
  - **Continuous Distribution**: 
  $$
  f_{1}(x) = \frac{3}{4}(1-x^{2})\quad \text{for } -1\le x \le 1 \\\\
  f_{2}(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  x + 1 & \text{for }x\in[-1,0],\\
  1 - x & \text{for }x\in(0,1].
  \end{array}
  \right.\\
  \Downarrow\\
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{i}(x)dx = 1 \quad \text{for } i = 1,2
  $$

```julia

pDiscrete = [0.25, 0.25, 0.5]
xGridD = 0:2

pContinous(x) = 3/4*(1-x^2)
xGridC = -1:0.01:1

pContinous2(x) = x < 0 ? x+1 : 1-x

p1 = plot(xGridD, line=:stem, pDiscrete, marker=:circle, c=:blue, ms=6, msw=0)
p2 = plot(xGridC, pContinous.(xGridC), c=:blue)
p3 = plot(xGridC, pContinous2.(xGridC),c=:blue)
