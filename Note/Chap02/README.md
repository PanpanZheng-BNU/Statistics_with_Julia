# Chapter02 Basic Probability
- ***Sample space***: The set of all possible outcome of a certain experiment.
  - i.e. Tossing a coin twice the sample space is $$\Omega = \{hh,ht,th,tt\}$$
- ***events***: each event is a subset of the sample space.
  - i.e. Let $$A$$ be the event of getting at least one heads: $$A = \{hh,ht,th\}$$
- ***probability measure*** denote here as as ***probability function***, which indicates the chance of each possible event occuring. 
  - i.e. $$\mathbb{P}(\cdot)$$ takes an event as argument and return a value in the range of $$[0,1]$$
  - $$\mathbb{P}(\emptyset)=0$$
  - $$\mathbb{P}(\Omega)=1$$
