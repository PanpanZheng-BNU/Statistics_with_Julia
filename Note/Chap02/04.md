# Conditional Probability
- ***Conditional probability*** of $$A$$ given $$B$$, denoted by $$\mathbb{P}(A\vert B)$$
$$
\mathbb{P}(A \vert B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}
$$
  - If $$A$$ and $$B$$ are independent events
  $$
  \mathbb{P}(A \vert B) = \mathbb{P}(A)
  $$
- ***Example*** Considering a gamer who rolls the dice twice without showing us the result. Event $$B$$ is the sum being greater or equal to 10, can be denoted by $$B = \{(i,j)\vert i+j \ge 10\}$$; Let $$A$$ be the event that the sum is even.
$$
\mathbb{P}(A\vert B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} = \frac{4/36}{6/36} = \frac{2}{3} \\
\mathbb{P}(A^{C} \vert B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A^{C} \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} = \frac{2/36}{6/36} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

## The Law of Total Probability
$$
\mathbb{P}(A\cap B) = \mathbb{P}(B)\mathbb{P}(A\vert B) \\\\
$$
- This is useful when there exists some *partition* of $$\Omega$$, namely, $$\{B_{1}, B_{2}, \cdots\}$$. A partition of a set $$U$$ is a collection of non-empty sets that are mutally **disjoint** and **whose union is $$U$$**. Such a partition allows us to represent $$A$$ as a diajoint union of the sets $$A\cap B$$, thus we have the ***law of total probability***
$$
\mathbb{P} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}(A\cap B_{k}) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}(A\vert B_{k})\mathbb{P}(B_{k})
$$
- ***Example***
  - Considering the world of semi-conductor manufacturing. Room cleaness in the manufacturing process is critical, and dust particles are kept to a minimum. Let $$A$$ be the event of a manufacturing failure, and assume that it dependents on the number of dust particles via
  $$
  \mathbb{P}(A\vert B_{k}) =  1 - \frac{1}{k+1}
  $$
  - Where $$B_{k}$$ is the event of having $$k$$ dust particles in the room, further assume that
  $$
  \mathbb{P}(B) = \frac{6}{\pi^{2}(k+1)^{2}} \quad \text{for } k = 0,1,\cdots
  $$
  - $$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}$$ is ***Riemann Zeta Funciton*** 
  $$
  \begin{array}{ll}
  \because & \mathbb{P}(A) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\mathbb{P}(A\vert B)\mathbb{P}(B) \\
  \therefore & \mathbb{P}(A) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\bigg(1 - \frac{1}{k+1}\bigg)\frac{6}{\pi^{2}(k+1)^{2}} \\
  \because & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{6} = \zeta(2)\\
  \therefore & \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 - \frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\zeta(3) \\
  \because & \zeta(3) \approx 1.2021 \\
  \therefore & \mathbb{P}(A) \approx 0.2692 \\
  \end{array}
  $$
